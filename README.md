# ðŸŽ¨ Day 17: Neural Style Transfer with Gradio

This is the seventeenth project of my #30DaysOfAI challenge. This project explores **Generative AI** by implementing the classic Neural Style Transfer algorithm and deploying it with **Gradio** on Hugging Face Spaces.

### âœ¨ Key Concepts
* **Neural Style Transfer:** An optimization technique used to take two imagesâ€”a content image and a style reference imageâ€”and blend them together so the output image retains the core content of the first image but is "painted" in the style of the second.
* **Pre-trained Models (VGG19):** The algorithm uses a pre-trained VGG19 network to extract content and style representations from the images.
* **Gradio for Deployment:** Instead of Streamlit, this project uses **Gradio**, a fast and simple framework for creating web UIs for machine learning models.

### ðŸ’» Tech Stack
- Python, Gradio, PyTorch, Torchvision
